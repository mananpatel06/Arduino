Interface 8 LEDs with Arduino UNO (digital 0 to digital 7). Develop an Arduino sketch for following: 
a. Toggle all LEDs continuously every 500 milliseconds. 
b. Toggle even and odd LEDs continuously for 2 seconds. 
c. Generate left series (i.e. used during Navaratri) 

Interface LED to normally open (NO) terminal of relay to Arduino. Develop an Arduino sketch to toggle LED every 3 seconds through relay.

Interface DC motor and Buzzer with Arduino. Develop an Arduino sketch to rotate motor anti-clockwise for 10 seconds after that sound buzzer for 2 seconds and silent at last. 

Interface seven segment LED display with Arduino. Write a program display first ODD numbers and then EVEN numbers on seven segment with delay of 1 second (the numbers are in between 0 to 9).

Write program to display 1 to 100 on LCD as follows

Write your name on LCD scroll left and scroll right 

Write program to show clock on LCD as follows

Display the string on LCD Ex.; “Hello World” 

Interface 4 push button & do following: 
** SW1 : when press, display 0 to 9 on LCD 
** SW2 : when press, display 00 to 99 on LCD 
** SW3 : when press, display 000 to 999 on LCD 
** SW4 : when press, display 0000 to 9999 on LCD 

Set the time using four switch and display the clock on LCD 
** SW1 : when press, increment 1 digit 
** SW2 : when press, decrement 1 digit 
** SW3 : when press, display set time and start the clock 
** SW4 : when press, reset the clock 

Receive serially data 0 to 9 and display on LCD 

Transmit “Hello World!” serially and display on monitor

Receive the data between 0 to 9 serially

Interface switch and do following: 
** SW1 : when press, transmit “Good Morning ” 
** SW1 : when open, transmit “Bad Morning ” 

Connect switch to Arduino. If switch is on than print ”ON” else print “OFF” on serial monitor. 

Interface temperature sensor, LCD and buzzer with Arduino UNO. Develop an Arduino sketch do follows: 
Display temperature on the LCD. 
If temperature is above 50 `C then sound the buzzer otherwise silent it. 

Interface Potentiometer and dc motor with Arduino Uno. Develop an Arduino sketch to control speed of DC motor using Potentiometer. 

Interface Potentiometer and servo motor with Arduino Uno. Develop an Arduino sketch to control angle of servo motor using potentiometer.

Identify bugs and resolve it to fulfill following objective. Interface 3 LEDs and 4 SWICHES with Arduino. Develop a program that by pressing 1st switch it will ON LED1, by pressing 2nd switch it ON LED2 and same for 3rd switch and LED3. By pressing 4th switch it will reset (OFF) all LEDs.
